# social-media-api

##Description

In this project I created routes for the backend of a social media platform using MongoDB as the database. The site allows the user to create, update, or delete a profile, add or delete friends, create, update, or delete posts, add or delete comments to associated posts, as well as view all users and posts or search for a specific user or post based on id.

##Installation

Run `npm i` to install the the associated packages and run `npm run seed` if seeding data is needed. Then run `node index,js` to start the program.

##Usage

A connection to MongoDB and an application such as Insomnia is required to use as this is just the back-end api portion.
